# dtrain

dtrain is a command to send dbus messages.
It attempts to be a more user friendly alternative to *dbus-send*.

## Requirements

Requires *ruby* and gems *ruby-dbus* and *test-unit* package.

    $ sudo apt install ruby
    $ sudo gem install ruby-dbus test-unit
    
## Install

Execute **make test** to test the program.
Then execute **make install** as a root to install.

## Usage

Start with executing the program without arguments.
This will list all services available on the session bus.

```
$ dtrain
ca.desrt.dconf
com.feralinteractive.GameMode
com.intel.dleyna-renderer
com.intel.dleyna-server
...
```

Add '--system' to use system bus, instead of the default session bus.

```
$ dtrain --system
org.bluez
org.freedesktop.Accounts
org.freedesktop.Avahi
org.freedesktop.ColorManager
org.freedesktop.DBus
org.freedesktop.Flatpak.SystemHelper
```

Use the service name as an argument to list objects and methods of the service.

```
$ dtrain org.gnome.ScreenSaver
/org/gnome/ScreenSaver
  org.gnome.ScreenSaver.GetActive
  org.gnome.ScreenSaver.GetActiveTime
  org.gnome.ScreenSaver.Lock
  org.gnome.ScreenSaver.SetActive
...
```

Often, the service name and object name can be derived from the interface name.
In this case we can call the method just by passing it as an argument.

```
$ dtrain org.gnome.ScreenSaver.GetActive
false
```

Object name can be specified as the first argument, followed by the method name.
The service name is derived from the interface name.

```
$ dtrain /org/gnome/SessionManager/App4 org.gnome.SessionManager.App.GetAppId
TODO what should be returned?
```

## TODO

- Some objects are missing,
  for example call "dtrain --system org.freedesktop.login1"
  is missing "/org/freedesktop/login1" object with interface "org.freedesktop.login1.Manager"
- call dbus method
  - nice print of a complex result, like in org.gtk.vfs.Daemon.ListMonitorImplementations
  - print multiple results? is there an example for this?
- better error message if the method call fails at the remote end
- accept method arguments
- argument --service
- better error messages in case the service and object cannot be derived
- better error message in case the session bus is not running
- list properties of a service
- get dbus property value
- set dbus property value
- monitor signal
